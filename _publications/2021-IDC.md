### About
The worldwide refugee crisis is a major current challenge, affecting the health and education of millions of families with children due to displacement. Despite the various challenges and risks of migration practices, numerous refugee families have access to interactive technologies during these processes. The aim of this ongoing study is to explore the role of technologies in the transitions of refugee families in Scotland. Based on Tudge’s ecocultural theory, a qualitative case-study approach has been adopted. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted with volunteers who work with refugee families in a big city in Scotland, and proxy observations of young children were facilitated remotely by their refugee parents. A preliminary overview of the participants’ insights of the use and role of technology for transitioning into a new culture is provided here.
