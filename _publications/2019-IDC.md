### About
Appropriately designed technology could help children feel less anxious by providing play opportunities with familiar technology in clinical settings as paediatric hospitals invest in making these spaces more child-friendly. However, the potential of technology-supported play in hospital environments has not been investigated extensively. This project thus aims at exploring how technology can support social play in a paediatric hospital with young children. A participatory approach to game design has been adopted, and a preliminary overview of children's insights of the first app iterations is provided here.
