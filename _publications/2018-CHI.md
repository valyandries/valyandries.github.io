### About
Children's access and engagement with digital products has surged in the past two decades, in parallel with paediatric hospital modernisation worldwide with the aim of turning them into child-friendly spaces. This is where children can be helped to feel less distressed by providing encounters with familiar technology. Nevertheless, the literature is sparse regarding the potential that technologies for children may have in relation to play in busy hospital settings. The scope of this PhD is thus to explore how digital technology can support social play among children aged 3-5, by involving various stakeholders in the process. This is in support of the new children's hospital in Edinburgh, to open in late 2018.
